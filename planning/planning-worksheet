## Project Description

This project is a mock up of a clothing store. It has a navigation bar with a drop down menu for items in the store and a search bar. It also has a login option and a shopping cart above the navigation bar. The welcome page features popular items and a user can click on a category in the navbar to be redirected to that page. When a user clicks on an item, they are redirected to a page that displays full item details and an option to add it to their cart. The shopping cart displays all the added items and provides the option to checkout. When a user logs in, they can see their previous orders and the items they saved in their cart. This project is made with a react frontend and a django backend with postgresql.

## Database Models
```
class Product(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
	pictureUrl = models.CharField(max_length=255)
	price = models.IntegerField()
	qty = models.IntegerField()
	size = models.CharField(max_length=100, choices=[('XS', 'XS'), ('S', 'S'),('M', 'M'), ('L', 'L'), ('XL', 'XL'),])
	description = models.TextField(blank=True)
	category = models.CharField(max_length=100, choices=[('Dresses', 'Dresses'), ('Tops', 'Tops'),('Bottoms', 'Bottoms'), ('Accessories', 'Accessories'), ('Sale', 'Sale'),])
class Order(models.Model):
	owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
	product = models.ManyToManyField(Product, related_name='products')
	created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
	def __str__(self):
		return self.name + ' ' + self.price

```

## Time/Priority Matrix

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
